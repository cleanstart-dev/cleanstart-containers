**CleanStart Container for Glibc**

The GNU C Library (glibc) container provides essential standard C libraries and utilities required for Linux applications. This container includes the complete GNU C Library implementation, featuring POSIX threading support, locale data, and core system libraries. It serves as a fundamental runtime dependency for applications requiring glibc compatibility, offering standardized C library functions, system calls, and internationalization support. The container is security-hardened and optimized for enterprise deployments, featuring minimal attack surface and FIPS-compliant cryptographic functions.

ðŸ“Œ **CleanStart Foundation**: Security-hardened, minimal base OS designed for enterprise containerized environments.
