**CleanStart Container for Redis Exporter**

Official Redis Exporter container image optimized for enterprise environments. Includes comprehensive Prometheus metrics collection for Redis instances and monitoring capabilities. Features security-hardened base image, minimal attack surface, and FIPS-compliant cryptographic modules. Supports both production deployments and development workflows with separate tagged versions. Includes Redis exporter, metrics collection, and essential monitoring tools.

**Key Features**
* Complete Redis monitoring environment with metrics collection
* Optimized for cloud-native and microservices architectures
* Support for Redis Standalone, Sentinel, and Cluster modes
* Export detailed Redis performance and operational metrics

**Common Use Cases**
* Building and deploying Redis monitoring
* Cloud-native observability development
* Redis performance monitoring and alerting
* Integration with Prometheus and Grafana stacks

**Pull Commands**
Download the runtime container images

```bash
docker pull cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest
docker pull cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest-dev
```

**Interactive Development**
Start interactive session for development

```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/sh cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest-dev
```

**Container Start**
Start the container
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name redis-exporter-dev -p 9121:9121 -e REDIS_ADDR=redis://localhost:6379 cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest
```

**Configuration Options**

The Redis Exporter supports various configuration options via environment variables:

* `REDIS_ADDR`: Redis server address (default: redis://localhost:6379)
* `REDIS_PASSWORD`: Redis password for authentication
* `REDIS_USER`: Redis user for ACL authentication
* `REDIS_EXPORTER_CHECK_KEYS`: Comma-separated list of keys to export
* `REDIS_EXPORTER_CHECK_SINGLE_KEYS`: Comma-separated list of single keys to export
* `REDIS_EXPORTER_SKIP_TLS_VERIFICATION`: Skip TLS certificate verification

**Example with Authentication**

```bash
docker run --rm -p 9121:9121 \
  -e REDIS_ADDR=redis://redis:6379 \
  -e REDIS_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest
```

**Best Practices**
* Use specific image tags for production (avoid latest)
* Configure resource limits: memory and CPU constraints
* Enable read-only root filesystem when possible
* Use authentication for Redis instances
* Set up proper network security and firewall rules

**Architecture Support**

**Multi-Platform Images**

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest
docker pull --platform linux/arm64 cleanstart/redis-exporter:latest
```
