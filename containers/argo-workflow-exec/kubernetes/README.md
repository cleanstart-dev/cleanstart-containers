# üöÄ Argo-Workflow-Exec Kubernetes Deployment

Simple Kubernetes deployment for testing CleanStart Argo Workflow Exec container.

## üìÅ Files

- `namespace.yaml` - Creates a dedicated namespace for testing
- `deployment.yaml` - Deployment with persistent pod for testing
- `job.yaml` - One-time job for testing (recommended)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GKE cluster with kubectl configured
- Sufficient permissions to create namespaces and deployments

### Option 1: Deploy as Job (Recommended)
```bash
# Apply all resources
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f job.yaml

# Watch the job
kubectl get jobs -n argo-workflow-exec-test -w

# Check job logs
kubectl logs -n argo-workflow-exec-test job/argo-workflow-exec-test-job -f
```

### Clean up Job
```bash
kubectl delete job argo-workflow-exec-test-job -n argo-workflow-exec-test
```

### Option 2: Deploy as Deployment
```bash
# Apply all resources
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# Check deployment status
kubectl get deployments -n argo-workflow-exec-test

# Get pod logs
kubectl logs -n argo-workflow-exec-test deployment/argo-workflow-exec-test -f
```

## üß™ Testing Commands

### Check Job Status
```bash
kubectl get jobs -n argo-workflow-exec-test
```

### View Job Logs
```bash
kubectl logs -n argo-workflow-exec-test job/argo-workflow-exec-test-job
```

### Check Pod Status
```bash
kubectl get pods -n argo-workflow-exec-test
```

### Describe Resources
```bash
kubectl describe job argo-workflow-exec-test-job -n argo-workflow-exec-test
kubectl describe deployment argo-workflow-exec-test -n argo-workflow-exec-test
```

### Clean up Deployment
```bash
kubectl delete deployment argo-workflow-exec-test -n argo-workflow-exec-test
```

### Clean up Namespace (removes everything)
```bash
kubectl delete namespace argo-workflow-exec-test
```

## üìã Expected Output

The container will run the same test script as the sample-project and should output:

```bash

- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory constraints applied
- **TTL cleanup**: Job automatically cleaned up after 5 minutes

### Resource Requirements
- **Memory**: 64Mi request, 128Mi limit
- **CPU**: 50m request, 100m limit
- **Namespace**: Isolated in `argo-workflow-exec-test`

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Job Fails to Start
```bash
kubectl describe job argo-workflow-exec-test-job -n argo-workflow-exec-test
```

### Pod Stuck in Pending
```bash
kubectl describe pod -n argo-workflow-exec-test -l app=argo-workflow-exec
```
