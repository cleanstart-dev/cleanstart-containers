```

**üè≠ Production Deployment**

**Deploy with production security settings:**

```bash
docker run -d --name minio-operator-sidecar-prod \
  --read-only \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  -e MINIO_OPERATOR_TLS_ENABLE=true \
  -e MINIO_OPERATOR_CLUSTER_NAME=prod-cluster \
  cleanstart/minio-operator-sidecar:latest
```

**üíæ Volume Mount**

**Mount a local directory for persistent configuration and certificates:**

```bash
docker run \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/opt/minio-operator/config \
  -v $(pwd)/certs:/opt/minio-operator/certs \
  cleanstart/minio-operator-sidecar:latest
```

**‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables**
**Variable	Default	Description**
MINIO_OPERATOR_TLS_ENABLE	false	Enable TLS for operator communications
MINIO_OPERATOR_CLUSTER_NAME	minio-cluster	Name of the MinIO cluster
MINIO_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE	minio-operator	Kubernetes namespace for the operator
MINIO_OPERATOR_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET	''	Image pull secret for private registries

**üîê Security Best Practices**

**Recommended configurations for secure deployments:**

Enable TLS for all communications

Implement proper RBAC policies

Use secure secrets management

Apply regular security patches and updates

Enforce network policies

Define resource quotas

**üõ°Ô∏è Kubernetes Security Context**

**Recommended security context for Kubernetes deployments:**

```bash
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
  fsGroup: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
