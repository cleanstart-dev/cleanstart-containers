# 🚀 Go Web Application - Beginner's Guide

Welcome to your first Go web application! This guide is designed for the enthusiatic people who trying to try and experiements with CleanStart Image with Go-Web application.

## 🎯 What This Application Does

This is a **User Management System** - think of it like a simple contact list or mini social media app where you can:
- ✅ **Add new users** (like adding friends to your phone contacts)
- ✅ **View all users** (like scrolling through your contact list)
- ✅ **Edit user information** (like updating a friend's phone number)
- ✅ **Delete users** (like removing a contact)

## 🛠️ What You Need (Prerequisites)

### Tools You'll Install:
1. **Docker** - Think of this as a "magic box" that contains everything your app needs
2. **A web browser** - Like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (you probably already have this!)

## 🚀 Quick Start (The Easy Way)

### Step 1: Install Docker
**What is Docker?** Docker is like a "magic box" that contains everything your application needs to run. It's like having a mini-computer inside your computer!

**How to install:**
1. Go to [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Download Docker Desktop for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Install it like any other software
4. Start Docker Desktop

**How to check if it's working:**
```bash
docker --version
```
If you see something like "Docker version 20.10.x", you're good to go!

### Step 2: Run the Application
**What we're doing:** We're going to start your web application using Docker.

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd containers/go/sample-project/go-web

# Start the application
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-web-app
```

**What this means:**
- `docker run` = "Start a new container (magic box)"
- `-p 8080:8080` = "Connect port 8080 on your computer to port 8080 in the container"
- `go-web-app` = "The name of our application"

### Step 3: Open Your Web Browser
1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8080`
3. You should see a web page with "User Management System"

**What is localhost?** Localhost means "this computer." So `http://localhost:8080` means "go to the website running on my computer at port 8080."

## 🎮 How to Use the Application

### Adding a New User
1. Click the "Add New User" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Enter the person's name (e.g., "John Doe")
   - **Email**: Enter their email (e.g., "john@example.com")
   - **Phone**: Enter their phone number (e.g., "123-456-7890")
3. Click "Add User"
4. You'll see the new user appear in the list!

### Viewing All Users
- All users are automatically displayed on the main page
- You can see their name, email, and phone number

### Editing a User
1. Click the "Edit" button next to any user
2. Change the information in the form
3. Click "Update User"
4. The user's information will be updated!

### Deleting a User
1. Click the "Delete" button next to any user
2. Confirm the deletion
3. The user will be removed from the list

## 🔧 For Advanced Beginners (Optional)

### What's Inside the Magic Box?

**The Application Structure:**
```
go-web/
├── main.go          # The main program file (like the "brain" of the app)
├── templates/       # HTML files (like the "face" of the app)
│   ├── index.html   # The main page
│   ├── add_user.html # The "add user" page
│   └── edit_user.html # The "edit user" page
├── go.mod           # Lists all the tools the app needs
├── Dockerfile       # Instructions for building the magic box
└── users.db         # The database (where user information is stored)
```

### Understanding the Code (Simplified)

**main.go** - The main program:
```go
// This is like the "brain" of your application
// It tells the computer what to do when someone visits your website

func main() {
    // Start the web server
    // Listen for people visiting your website
    // Show them the right pages
}
```

**What each part does:**
- `GET /` = "When someone visits the main page, show them the user list"
- `POST /api/users` = "When someone submits the add user form, save the new user"
- `GET /api/users` = "When someone asks for the user list, give them the data"

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (Common Problems)

### Problem: "Docker command not found"
**Solution:** Docker isn't installed or isn't running
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed
2. Start Docker Desktop
3. Wait for it to fully start (you'll see a green icon)

### Problem: "Port 8080 is already in use"
**Solution:** Something else is using port 8080
```bash
# Use a different port
docker run -p 8081:8080 go-web-app
# Then go to http://localhost:8081
```

### Problem: "Cannot connect to the application"
**Solution:** Check if the container is running
```bash
# See all running containers
docker ps

# If you don't see go-web-app, start it again
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-web-app
```

### Problem: "The page doesn't load"
**Solution:** Check your browser
1. Make sure you're going to `http://localhost:8080` (not `https://`)
2. Try a different browser
3. Check if your firewall is blocking the connection


## 🔗 What's Next?

After you're comfortable with this application, you can:

1. **Try other sample projects from another directories of cleanStart-containers images**
   - Python web app (similar but uses Python)
   - Java web app (similar but uses Java)
   - Node.js web app (similar but uses JavaScript)

**Remember:** Every expert was once a beginner. Keep practicing, keep learning, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - that's how you learn!

**Happy Coding! 🚀**
