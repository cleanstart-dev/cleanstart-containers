Includes standard Go tools like go test, go fmt, and go mod for dependency management.


**Key Features**
* Complete Go development environment with compiler and standard library
* Optimized for cloud-native and microservices architectures

**Common Use Cases**
* Building and deploying Go microservices
* Cloud-native application development
